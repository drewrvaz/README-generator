#README-generator

## Description

I wanted to create a way for a user to create a professional ReadMe through the console using Node.js. It seemed like a simple way to be able to create a ReadMe while answering prompts so that a user doesn't need to keep looking back at a guide to see how to properly write a ReadMe. I learned how to use Node.js to create a prompt based file builder.

## User Story

```md
AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project
```

## Installation
In order to install the project, the user needs to have node.js downloaded on their computer. Then they can pull the repository and add it to their project.

## Usage

To use the ReadMe generator, the User jsut needs to run node.js in their console with the index.js file that I created. They can then answer the prompts and it will spit out their own custom ReadMe titled "newREADME.md".
